# BIOSTAT 706 Final

This is a secondary analysis of the DIG Digoxin trial. The general goal is to understand the relationship between baseline potassium levels and results of the DIG trial.

1)	Are baseline subject characteristics (Baseline Form + derived variables age, BMI, NSYM, and TRTMT) associated with baseline potassium levels? 
2)	Are baseline potassium levels (KLEVEL) associated with increased risk of hospitalization for worsened heart failure (WHF on Event Form)?
3)	Does baseline potassium level interact with Digoxin treatment to change effect of treatment on hospitalization for worsened heart failure?

The outcome variable of interest is hospitalization for worsening heart failure (WHF).  The main independent variable of interest is serum potassium at baseline (KLEVEL). The randomization variable is TRTMT.

Note that this is an analysis done for a final project for a course, and thus the results should only be considered within that context.
